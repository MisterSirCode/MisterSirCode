Welcome. I'm an enthusiast of material science who occassionally programs. I collect minerals, elements, chemicals, artificial materials, exotic materials, wood species, and many other oddities. 

You can view my website (tonsof.rocks) for a peek at a small bit of my collection, or visit my biggest project right now (syndat.org) for some detailed information on synthetic / exotic materials.
